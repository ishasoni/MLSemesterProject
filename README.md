Machine Learning 

The following code was constructed to implement the "Detection of public sentiment and its influence on the daily Bitcoin price fluctuations" machine learning project. 

We built code in in OOP manner to collect the twitter data, pre-process the data, train the data, and implement the learning algorithms. 
External libraries where used to compute mathematical equations, construct the learning algorithms, and train the data.

Executing the code will require all code that is not currently commented out needs to stay as it is necessary for execution. 
The only modification that are required to is to uncomment the specific learning algorithm that needs to be tested when needing to execute. 
For example
